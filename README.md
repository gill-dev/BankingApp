<h3 align="left">Technical Challenge</h3>
<p>I used Redux and RTK with NextJs.</p>
<p align="left">
  ## Tech
- [NextJS] 
- [Redux / Redux Toolkit]
- [Tailwind]
- [ShadCN]
</p>

<h3 align="left">Installation</h3>
<p align="left">

npm i

</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>The project took me roughly 12 hours. I am happy with the infrastructure of the NextJs and Redux with RTK. I chose Redux and NextJs as I know it is used in Starling</p>

<p>I used Tailwind CSS and ShadCN - a interesting new UI kit!</p>
<h3>Further Improvements</h3>
<p>With more time I wouldve implemented testing using Jest or React Testing library</p>
<p>I would polish and complete UI elements</p>
